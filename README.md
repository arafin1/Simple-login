# Angular Messages

`Angular Messages` is a demo application to show how to implement `JWT` authentication with a `Rails` backend and an `Angular` frontend.

If you want to try it, you need to do the following:

Configure and run `Rails`:

```
$ bundle install
$ rails s
```

And then, `lineman` (for `Angular`):

```
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ lineman run
```

Having both application started, you can navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`
